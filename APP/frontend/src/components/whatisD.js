      Diabetes is a long-term medical illness that impacts the body's ability to
      utilise food as fuel. Your body converts carbs from food into glucose, a
      form of sugar that cells need as fuel. The pancreas secretes the hormone
      insulin, which aids in the movement of glucose from the bloodstream into
      the cells. High blood glucose levels are a result of issues with insulin
      use or synthesis in people with diabetes. Diabetes comes in a variety of
      forms, including:
      <br /> <br /> <br />
      1. Type 1 Diabetes: This kind develops when the immune system
      unintentionally targets and kills the pancreatic cells that produce
      insulin. Insulin pumps or injections are the only ways that people with
      type 1 diabetes can control their blood sugar levels.
      <br /> <br /> <br />
      2. Type 2 Diabetes: This condition is characterized by insufficient
      insulin production or a heightened bodily resistance to the effects of
      insulin. This is the most prevalent kind of diabetes and is frequently
      associated with bad eating habits, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle.
      There are instances when insulin therapy, medicine, or lifestyle
      modifications are necessary to manage type 2 diabetes.
      <br /> <br /> <br />
      3. Gestational Diabetes: This kind of diabetes normally goes away after
      giving birth and develops throughout pregnancy. On the other hand, type 2
      diabetes is more likely to strike women who have experienced gestational
      diabetes in the future. Diabetes can cause a number of symptoms, such as
      thirst, blurred vision, weariness, unexplained weight loss, and sluggish
      wound healing. Diabetes can cause major side effects like heart disease,
      stroke, kidney disease, nerve damage, and visual loss if it is
      inadequately managed or left untreated. Diabetes management include
      controlling blood sugar levels with a mix of prescription drugs (such as
      insulin or oral medications), a good diet, frequent exercise, blood sugar
      monitoring, and, in certain situations, weight control. It is imperative
      that individuals with diabetes undergo routine medical treatment and
      screenings in order to prevent or identify complications at an early
      stage.
